# PSR Wiki Scrape

This R code scrapes data from the political science discussion website, http://www.poliscirumors.com to estimate the likelihood of a paper being accepted (or given an R&R) based on the amount of time since submission.

On the website, users upload the journal to which they submitted their paper, the result of the submission, months from submission to first response and number of referee reports, among other factors.

The script also includes code for a simple model and a plot to see the likelihood of a paper being accepted based on the time from submission to first response as well as the number of referees.
